# DRP-template
LaTeX preamble/style for the dissertation research proposal (DRP) document, following the guidelines.

This was made as a GitHub repository template, so you can freely use it to write yor own DRP.

Besides the preamble/style ready to be used, you can consult [own DRP document](./DRP_Victor_Alves_example.pdf) that I generated using LaTeX template.

Victor Alves.
