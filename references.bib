abstract = {Abstract The objective in this work is to propose a novel approach for solving inverse problems from the output space to the input space using automatic differentiation coupled with the implicit function theorem and a path integration scheme. A common way of solving inverse problems in process systems engineering (PSE) and in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in general is using nonlinear programming (NLP) tools, which may become computationally expensive when both the underlying process model complexity and dimensionality increase. The proposed approach takes advantage of recent advances in robust automatic differentiation packages to calculate the input space region by integration of governing differential equations of a given process. Such calculations are performed based on an initial starting point from the output space and are capable of maintaining accuracy and reducing computational time when compared to using NLP-based approaches to obtain the inverse mapping. Two nonlinear case studies, namely a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a membrane reactor for conversion of natural gas to value-added chemicals are addressed using the proposed approach and compared against: (i) extensive (brute-force) search for forward mapping and (ii) using NLP solvers for obtaining the inverse mapping. The obtained results show that the novel approach is in agreement with the typical approaches, while computational time and complexity are considerably reduced, indicating that a new direction for solving inverse problems is developed in this work.}

abstract = "A steady state, multivariable, and nonlinear measure is presented for assessing the inputâ€“output, open-loop controllability of a process. This measure ascertains the inherent controllability of the process, as it is calculated in the absence of any regulatory control structure. For the process examples utilized in this paper, it is also independent of the inventory control structure that might be assumed present in order to keep the inventory levels constant. This measure evaluates the ability of a design to reach all points of the desired output space and to reject the expected disturbances utilizing input action not exceeding the available input space. Besides being applicable to a SISO (Single Input, Signal Output) case, its multivariable character is shown to be more appropriate than existing measures such as RGA (Relative Gain Array), minimum singular value, and condition number."

abstract = "This paper introduces a novel operability-based framework for process design and intensification of modular systems. This framework is based on nonlinear programming concepts, including bilevel optimization, and extends the application domain of classical operability approaches to process simulator runs (Aspen Plus) for obtaining the relationship between input and output spaces, in addition to first-principles models. As potential modular applications of the proposed approach, a catalytic membrane reactor (MR) for the direct methane aromatization (DMA) conversion to fuels and chemicals, and a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) system for power generation, are addressed. These applications are especially motivated by the advent of the shale gas revolution that allowed the recent discovery of stranded shale/natural gas deposits at different shale formations in the U.S. The utilization of such deposits could be capitalized by employing modular technologies for the production of power, value-added chemicals and fuels at the site. However, the design and intensification of modular energy systems is a challenging task as these processes are represented by complex and nonlinear models. The obtained results indicate that the proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the realization of the concept of modular manufacturing with reduced footprint and maximized efficiency, resulting in future cost savings. In particular for the NGCC process, the results provide the gas and steam turbine cycle conditions that could enable modular plants that are about three orders of magnitude smaller in terms of power generation than typical operating processes."
